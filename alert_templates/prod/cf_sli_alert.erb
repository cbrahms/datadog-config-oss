  "message": "## Description:\nCF Push SLI has reported failure several times within the last ten minutes.\n\nhttps://concourse.lakitu.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/cf:cf-sli/jobs/cf-sli-ruby\n\nThis probably means that the app is failing to stage or start successfully. It could also mean that the CF CLI is failing to communicate with the CF at some point. CF Push is takes about a dozen HTTP calls and involves most CF components.\n\n <%= cloudops_pagerduty %>   \n\n## Escalation Path:\n  CAPI, Diego \n\n## Possible Causes:\nLast updated July 3 2017\n\n### Bundler failure\nWe think we fixed this by vendoring dependencies correctly, but maybe we're wrong! If so, please write & prioritize a chore to convert this app to Go or Java, because we really want this test to be insulated from network failures.\n\n###Diego cell is unhealthy\nSaw a flurry of staging failures July 3 2017. A cell became unhealthy and then was presumably fixed by a Bosh scan-and-fix. Eric thinks ClamAV is likely implicated.\n\n###CAPI can't find Diego BBS during MySQL deploys\nThis can be checked quickly by looking for deploy alerts in the #cf-diego channel. Locket has a known issue during MySQL deploys. The Diego team is investigating and fixing.\n\n### Dependency for the CC stats endpoint is failing\nWe've seen push failures when CAPI couldn't contact Doppler nodes successfully. The CAPI team is aware of this and should be working on failing more gracefully in this case. Though if it appears that this has happened again we should follow up with them.\n\n### Other possibilities\nThe basic dependency list for Push\nUAA (and its database)\nS3 blob store\nCC and CCDB\nDiego staging cell\nDiego BBS\nRouter\nDoppler (hopefully by the time you're reading this, this is out of date)\n\n## Potential Solutions:\n\n##Feedback:\n Have feedback for this alert?
