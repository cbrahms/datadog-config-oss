  "message": "The go-routers are complaining about TLS certs being invalid. Are the certificates out of sync between the control plane and cell block deployments?\n\nThis alert attempts to use the metric's rate change to decide if it should alert or not.\nThis metric is a counter that grows monotonically.\n\nFor more history on this alert see:\n- https://pivotalcloudopspws.datadoghq.com/monitors/10784390\n- https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167662632\n\nNOTES:\n\nEach go-router is reporting its monotonically increasing count of witnessed TLS handshake failures. This means the metric will only grow. Additionally, the metric can appear spiky due to router count differences and less than synchronized router checkin intervals.\n\nV0: this metric starts with the largest value seen in a 60 second window. (This ensures the largest router count is always taken; so, there is less rate change noise.) From these maxes, it calculates the rate of change (over one minute intervals) and finally alerts when that rate breaks 0.5 and stops when the rate falls back down. So, it doesn't stay active while counts aren't moving. This means it is very sensitive to change, I am curious to see if it is a useful metric!",
