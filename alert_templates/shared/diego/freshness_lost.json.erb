  "message": "Diego expects CAPI to periodically mark Desired State items as \"fresh.\" See the Diego LRP documentation for a detailed explanation: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bbs/blob/master/doc/lrps.md\n\nRight now what this probably means is that either CAPI isn't sending those freshness updates to Diego anymore, or the BBS has locked up and isn't able to process requests. It might also mean that the two jobs are working fine but can't communicate effectively.\n\nFigure out which it is, then escalate to the appropriate team.\n\nIf there's no data, confirm that the SLIs are still succeeding, then make a story in the backlog to follow up during normal business hours. You may need to mute this alert until then.\n\nLast updated 11/1/2017\n\n@pagerduty-datadog-cloudops-<%= environment %>",
