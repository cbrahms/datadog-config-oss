It might also mean that the two jobs are working fine, but networking between them is broken.\n\nFigure out which it is, then escalate to the appropriate team.\n\nYou might try:\n1. Looking for failing jobs with `bosh vms --ps` or `bosh vms --vitals` (or in Datadog metrics)\n2. Checking the `<%= environment %>-diego-health` dashboard in Datadog\n3. Checking the NewRelic `Cloud Controller (<%= deployment %>)` app\n4. Checking the logs for CAPI and the Diego BBS\n\nIf nothing is obviously wrong (process has crashed, log file full of errors, transactions have cratered, etc.) escalate to the secondary on-call, or the whole CloudOps team.\n\nIf there's no data, confirm that the SLIs are still succeeding, then make a story in the backlog to follow up during normal business hours. You may need to mute this alert until then.\n\n <%= cloudops_pagerduty %>",
