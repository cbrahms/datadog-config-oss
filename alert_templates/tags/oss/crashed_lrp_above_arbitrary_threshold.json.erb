  "message": "## Description:\n  Number of Diego Crashed LRPs(long running processes) has increased significantly in the past day\n\n## Escalation Path:\n  Diego/Garden team\n\n## Causes:\n  Usually the Crashed LRPs are quite stable in the platform. If the count climbs unexpectedly, that may be an indication that some cells are in an abnormal state. We usually see the metric increase during deploys as cells roll.\n\n## Potential Solutions:\nExplore why the number of LRP crashes increased.\n  - If this increase appears to be due natural application instance growth or an ongoing deploy, mute this monitor for a day and confirm that it recovers tomorrow.\n  - Otherwise, consider escalating to the Diego team\n @slack-pws-notifications @slack-cf-diego",
